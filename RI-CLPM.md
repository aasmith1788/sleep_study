Yamada et al. (2022) studied how pain and fatigue influence each other over time in patients undergoing rehabilitation after knee surgery. They used weekly self-reports of pain and fatigue across three time points (weeks 0, 5, and 10) to analyze how changes in one might predict changes in the other. Their main finding was that pain strongly predicted later fatigue, but fatigue did not predict later pain.

IF the data contain perfect linear trends
AND IF we use person-specific means as random intercepts
THEN the residuals will be symmetrical around zero
AND cross-lagged estimates won't be biased by those specific linear trends is this true
